## Description
Budget Tracker is a Progressive Web App (PWA) where you can add and subtract funds to track your total budget. Transactions are added to the list along with the amount added or subtracted, and the total is displayed at the top of the app. 
IndexedDB and the Cache API are used to enable this app to function while offline as a PWA and the app is also able to be installed on your desktop or mobile device as well.
